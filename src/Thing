Ja'von Elliott - During this past summer I worked, Took care of my son, and spent two weeks at camp Atterburry for the national guard. I use to be a supervisor at Kohls and I enjoyed my job as well. 
In the military I am a field artillery specialst. I have been doing that for around 5 years. I just recently left my job to focus on my last year of school.
